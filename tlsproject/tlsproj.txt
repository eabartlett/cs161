2. The random_int() function takes in time(NULL) as the input to the srand() function, so if an attacker was using a computer with a similar internal clock as ours, then they could easily predict the output of random_int(). In other words, since NULL is a non-random value, an adversary could easily replicate the random value that we are using in our implementation because the adversary could easily infer the seed that we are using.
