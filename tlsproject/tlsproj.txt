------ Questions ------
1.  An attacker could complete a denial of service attack by spoofing either the client
or server's IP address and sending packets with error types or non-existent
types as a type of RST injection. Because of the way we wrote our code either
of these types will cause the code to terminate the connection.

2. The random_int() function takes in time(NULL) as the input to the srand() function,
so if an attacker was using a computer with a similar internal clock as ours, then
they could easily predict the output of random_int(). In other words, since NULL is
a non-random value, an adversary could easily replicate the random value that we are
using in our implementation because the adversary could easily infer the seed that we
are using.
